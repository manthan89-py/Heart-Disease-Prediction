# Heart-Disease-Prediction ‚≠ê :

* This project is combination of data analysis and machine learning. 
* In this project First I try to find features and make different three type of models. 
* If any case .ipynb or .pdf files will not load you can use markdown (.md) file.
* Do some analysis and finally getting accuracy of 86% on test data.
* For this project you must have knowledge of 
  * Logistic Regression
  * Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Corelation Matrix
  * Plots of Seaborn
* Dataset taken from kaggle and link & description of dataset is available in code file.
